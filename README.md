Using the processed highUtilizationPredictionV2wco data table:

1. Test how logistic and random forest models behave outside the original 65-90 age range. It is reasonable to assume that for such patients the models will perform correctly?

2. Select randomly one patient from the data. Apply distortion of data to the patient 1000 times. Analyze probabilities output from the model for the distorted patient as compared with the original patient. Does the prediction/class change?
